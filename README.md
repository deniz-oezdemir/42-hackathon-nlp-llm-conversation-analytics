# Step 1: Import the evaluation data

The evaluation data you'll be working with has already been pre-packaged for you so you do not need to worry about parsing or downloading the data.
If you want to look broadly at all the different communities and the files associated with them, you can do so by navigating to the `data/groups` folder. As you'll see, there's 10 different communities associated with different Telegram groups for you to choose from. For our case, we'll be focusing on the Cere Network community, associated with the `thisiscere` Telegram group.

In every community, the data is organized into the following file types:

<details>
<summary><strong>Community Group Chat Data containing the conversations - Inputs to the experimentation</strong></summary>

The input data contains complete conversation histories from each Telegram community group chat, including message content, timestamps, and user information. This serves as the primary source for all our analysis tasks.

  * File path: `data/groups/thisiscere/messages_thisiscere.csv`
  * Contains original conversation content, timestamps, and user information
  * Primary input for all evaluations

    | ID | Text | Timestamp | Username | First Name | Last Name |
    |----|------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
    | 36569 | "You create your own attack and burn yourself…it makes no sense when the supply is still 10% and there is no real use case for the $cere token." | 2025-01-14T01:22:56Z | goldgold888 | TT | |
    | 36570 | "That will be improved in the future. I think Burning the supply using tokens from the Treasury is a positive thing. The aim is to reduce inflation." | 2025-01-14T01:25:40Z | Richnd | Richnd | \| I will never DM you first |

<summary><strong>Ground Truth Files - Human-verified, manually labeled data that serves as the benchmark for measuring model accuracy</strong></summary>

These files contain human-annotated labels for conversations and spam messages, serving as the gold standard against which we evaluate model performance. Each file represents a different aspect of the ground truth: conversation groupings and spam identification.

  * `data/groups/thisiscere/GT_conversations_thisiscere.csv`: Manual conversation grouping labels

    | Message ID | Conversation ID |
    |------------|----------------|
    | 36569 | 1 |
    | 36570 | 1 |
    | 36587 | 3 |
    | 36588 | 3 |
    | 36582 | 2 |

  * `data/groups/thisiscere/GT_spam_thisiscere.csv`: Manual spam classification labels

    | Message ID | Is Spam |
    |------------|---------|
    | 36569 | 0 |
    | 36570 | 0 |
    | 36587 | 0 |
    | 36588 | 0 |
    | 36582 | 0 |
</details>

For readability's sake, for every individual file, we've provided just a small sample of the data. You're welcome to look at the full data in the `data/groups/thisiscere` folder.

# Step 3: Show the results

## Main Task - Conversation Clustering Results

<details>
<summary><strong>📄 Model Output Format</strong></summary>

  <br/>

  Results will be stored as `metrics_conversations_[community_name].csv` in your community's folder.

  For example, for the Cere Network community: `data/groups/thisiscere/metrics_conversations_thisiscere.csv`

  The model generates a CSV file following the naming convention:
  `data/groups/<community_name>/labels_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>_mistral7b_<community_name>.csv`

  For example, if you're evaluating the Cere Network community (thisiscere) and run the script on February 25, 2025 at 20:22:30, the output file will be:
  `data/groups/thisiscere/labels_20250225_202230_mistral7b_thisiscere.csv`

  The file will have the following format (and for readability, we've only included a sample of the data):
  ```csv
  message_id,conversation_id,topic,timestamp,labeler_id,confidence
  36598,1,Token Discussion,2021-07-14T14:26:50Z,mistral7b,0.85
  36635,2,Project Updates,2025-01-15T02:52:44Z,mistral7b,0.82
  36638,0,Spam Message,2025-01-15T04:31:48Z,mistral7b,0.95
  ```

  Which translates to this more readable table:

  | Message ID | Conversation ID | Topic | Timestamp | Labeler ID | Confidence |
  |------------|----------------|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
  | 36598 | 1 | Token Discussion | 2021-07-14T14:26:50Z | mistral7b | 0.85 |
  | 36635 | 2 | Project Updates | 2025-01-15T02:52:44Z | mistral7b | 0.82 |
  | 36638 | 0 | Spam Message | 2025-01-15T04:31:48Z | mistral7b | 0.95 |

  You might be wondering - how well did the model perform? Is it good? Is it bad? To answer this question, we need to look at the performance metrics.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Performance Metrics</strong></summary>

  <br/>

  If you want to see what the performance metrics are for the model predictions you've just generated, you can run the following command:

  ```bash
  python conversation_metrics.py data/groups/thisiscere
  ```

  This will generate a CSV file with the performance metrics for the model predictions. It will take into account several reference models that have been already evaluated on the same data (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek V3), as well as the model you've just run (Mistral 7B).

  To calculate the metrics, the script "looks at":
  * what labels all the models generated (in the directory associated with the community), for example:
    - `data/groups/thisiscere/labels_20250131_143535_gpt4o_thisiscere.csv`
    - `data/groups/thisiscere/labels_20250131_171944_claude35s_thisiscere.csv`
    - `data/groups/thisiscere/labels_20250131_185300_deepseekv3_thisiscere.csv`
    - `data/groups/thisiscere/labels_20250225_202230_mistral7b_thisiscere.csv`
  * what the labels are for the ground truth (manually labelled by a human):
    - `data/groups/thisiscere/GT_conversations_thisiscere.csv`

  and then calculates the metrics based on that.

  The big picture understanding you need to have is, the closer the model labels are to the ground truth, the better the model is. The perfect score is 1, and the worst score is -1.

  If you want to understand this evaluation on a deeper level, you can read more about the metrics in the [Knowledge Base](#useful-links).

  | Model | ARI Score (-1 to 1) | Messages Processed | Notes |
  |-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
  | GPT-4 | 0.583 | 49 | Moderate conversation grouping accuracy |
  | DeepSeek V3 | 0.865 | 67 | Best performance, processed most messages |
  | Claude 3.5 | 0.568 | 49 | Moderate conversation grouping accuracy |
  | Mistral 7B | 0.219 | 27 | Lower accuracy, processed fewer messages |


  **Now you can see how the open source, locally deployed model performs against the big players 🏆 (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek V3). As you can see, there's quite a performance gap - the ARI score for the smaller model is 0.219, while the big players are around 0.865 (with 1 being the perfect score).**

  **Your focus and core task is to try to close this gap 🎯 by experimenting with different models, different parameters, different system prompts, etc.**

  **Now that you understand this context, you can start experimenting! Feel free to jump straight into step number 4, referenced here: [Step 4: Experiment with different models](#step-4-experiment-with-different-models)**

<summary><strong>📚 Knowledge Base - Theory behind evaluation metrics</strong></summary>

### Main Task: Conversation Clustering
The primary focus of our evaluation framework is the accurate clustering of messages into coherent conversations. This is the core challenge that directly impacts the quality of community analytics.

<details>
<summary><strong>Conversation Clustering</strong></summary>

The quality of conversation clustering is evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), a standard metric for comparing clustering results:

### Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
  * Measures the similarity between two clusterings by considering all pairs of messages and checking whether they are grouped together or separately in both clusterings
  * Ranges from -1 to 1, where:
    - 1 indicates perfect agreement with ground truth
    - 0 indicates random labeling
    - Negative values indicate less agreement than expected by chance
  * Advantages:
    - Accounts for chance groupings
    - Handles different numbers of conversations
    - Independent of conversation labels/IDs

### ARI Calculation Process
   * First, convert to pair-wise relationships:
     - Ground Truth pairs in same conversation:
       * (msg1,msg2), (msg1,msg4), (msg2,msg4)  # Group 1
       * (msg3,msg5)                            # Group 2

     - Model Output pairs in same conversation:
       * (msg1,msg2)                           # Group 100
       * (msg3,msg5)                           # Group 101
       * msg4 alone in Group 102

   * ARI Score = 0.4 (moderate agreement) because:
     - Correctly grouped: (msg1,msg2), (msg3,msg5)
     - Incorrectly separated: msg4 from (msg1,msg2)

This example demonstrates how even with different conversation IDs (1,2 vs 100,101,102), ARI effectively measures clustering agreement by comparing pair-wise relationships between messages.
</details>

### Additional Tasks
The following tasks complement the main conversation clustering evaluation, providing additional insights into model capabilities:

<details>
<summary><strong>Topic Labeling (Optional ⭐)</strong></summary>

The evaluation of topic labels focuses on how well they capture and convey the essential information from conversations. Using principles from information theory, each topic label is evaluated against the actual conversation content it represents.

### Evaluation Framework
Topic labels are assessed by an expert system using the following information-theoretic criteria:

1. **Information Density** (1-10 scale):
   * Balance between brevity and informativeness
   * Optimal compression of conversation meaning
   * Example: "BTC Price Analysis Q4 2023" (9/10) vs "Crypto Discussion" (3/10)

2. **Redundancy Elimination**:
   * Penalizes repetitive or unnecessary information
   * Measures information efficiency
   * Example: "Bitcoin BTC Crypto Price" (low score due to redundancy) vs "Bitcoin Price Trends" (high score)

3. **Contextual Relevance**:
   * How well the label captures key conversation elements
   * Alignment with actual message content
   * Example: For a technical discussion about blockchain architecture, "Ethereum Gas Optimization" (high relevance) vs "ETH Discussion" (low relevance)

4. **Label Efficiency**:
   * Ratio of useful information to label length
   * Optimal use of each word/term
   * Example: "DeFi Liquidity Pool Returns" (efficient) vs "Discussion About Various Aspects of Decentralized Finance Liquidity Pools" (inefficient)

### Scoring System
Labels are scored on a 1-10 scale where:
- **1-2**: Severely problematic
  * Too vague or incomprehensible
  * Example: "Crypto stuff"
- **3-4**: Poor information value
  * Too generic or extremely redundant
  * Example: "Bitcoin cryptocurrency digital currency discussion"
- **5-6**: Acceptable but suboptimal
  * Conveys basic meaning but lacks precision
  * Example: "Cryptocurrency trading"
- **7-8**: Good balance
  * Clear, informative, efficient
  * Example: "BTC-ETH Price Correlation Analysis"
- **9-10**: Excellent
  * Optimal information density
  * Highly descriptive yet concise
  * Example: "L2 Rollup Performance Benchmarks Q1 2024"

### Example Evaluation

1. **Sample Conversation**:
   ```   User1: "How's Arbitrum's TPS compared to other L2s?"
   User2: "Currently around 40-50k TPS"
   User3: "Optimism is showing similar numbers"
   User1: "What about transaction costs?"
   User2: "Arb slightly cheaper, around $0.1-0.3 per tx"
   ```

2. **Topic Label Evaluation**:
   ```
   Label: "L2 Scaling: Arbitrum vs Optimism Performance"
   Score: 9/10
   Reasoning:
   - Specifies the exact L2 solutions being compared
   - Indicates the comparison is about performance
   - Captures both TPS and cost aspects
   - Concise yet comprehensive
   ```

3. **Alternative Label Analysis**:
   ```
   "L2 Discussion" - Score: 3/10
   - Too vague, loses critical information
   - Fails to capture comparative aspect
   - Missing specific solutions discussed

   "Detailed Technical Analysis of Layer 2 Blockchain Solutions Including Arbitrum and Optimism Transaction Speed Comparisons" - Score: 4/10
   - Unnecessarily verbose
   - High redundancy
   - Poor information-to-length ratio
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spam Detection (Optional ⭐)</strong></summary>

Spam classification is evaluated using standard binary classification metrics. In our framework, spam messages are identified by `conversation_id = 0` in model outputs.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**: Accuracy of spam identification (minimize false positives)
  * Formula: `true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)`
  * Critical for avoiding misclassification of legitimate messages
  * Example: Precision of 0.95 means 95% of messages labeled as spam are actually spam

- **Recall**: Completeness of spam detection (minimize false negatives)
  * Formula: `true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)`
  * Important for catching all spam messages
  * Example: Recall of 0.90 means 90% of all actual spam messages were caught

- **F1 Score**: Balanced measure of precision and recall
  * Formula: `2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`
  * Single metric for overall spam detection performance
  * Helps balance the trade-off between precision and recall

### Example Evaluation

1. **Sample Messages and Ground Truth**:
   ```csv
   message_id,text,is_spam
   msg1,"Check out crypto profits now!",1
   msg2,"What's the BTC price?",0
   msg3,"FREE BITCOIN click here!!!",1
   msg4,"Around $48k right now",0
   msg5,"Make 1000% gains guaranteed!!",1
   ```

2. **Model Output**:
   ```csv
   message_id,conversation_id,confidence
   msg1,0,0.95        # Correctly identified spam
   msg2,1,0.88        # Correctly identified non-spam
   msg3,0,0.92        # Correctly identified spam
   msg4,1,0.85        # Correctly identified non-spam
   msg5,2,0.70        # Missed spam (false negative)
   ```

3. **Metric Calculation**:
   ```
   True Positives (TP) = 2  (msg1, msg3)
   False Positives (FP) = 0
   True Negatives (TN) = 2  (msg2, msg4)
   False Negatives (FN) = 1  (msg5)

   Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = 2/(2+0) = 1.00
   Recall = TP/(TP+FN) = 2/(2+1) = 0.67
   F1 Score = 2 * (1.00 * 0.67)/(1.00 + 0.67) = 0.80
   ```

4. **Confidence Analysis**:
   * High confidence (>0.90) for clear spam patterns
   * Lower confidence (0.70-0.85) for ambiguous cases
   * Threshold of 0.80 used for spam classification

#### Common Spam Patterns
Models are evaluated on their ability to detect:
- Promotional language and excessive punctuation
- Unrealistic promises and urgency
- Suspicious links and contact information
- Repetitive message patterns
- Cross-posting across conversations

The evaluation emphasizes high precision to avoid disrupting legitimate conversations while maintaining acceptable recall for effective spam control.

# Step 4: Your First Challenge - Experiment with Different Models

In Step 2, we used a script specifically designed for Mistral 7B (`open_source_examples/mistral.py`). Now, we'll use a more flexible, general-purpose script (`model_playground.py`) that can work with any model available through Ollama. This script is designed to be configurable through a YAML file, allowing you to easily experiment with different models, parameters, and system prompts without changing the code.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Practical Guide: How to Experiment with Different Models</strong></summary>

<br/>

1. First, check if Ollama is running and start it if needed:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama serve

# If you see "address already in use", Ollama is already running
# If not running, the command above will start the server
```

2. Pull the model you want to experiment with:
```bash
# Try different models available in Ollama
ollama pull llama2
ollama pull codellama
ollama pull phi
```

3. Configure your experiment in `open_source_examples/model_config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Update the model configuration
model:
  name: "phi"  # Model name
  temperature: 0.3  # Lower for more focused outputs
  max_tokens: 1000  # Response length limit
  top_p: 0.95  # Sampling parameter
```

4. Run your experiment:
```bash
# Use the general-purpose script with your config
python model_playground.py data/groups/thisiscere/messages_thisiscere.csv
```

5. Compare results:
```bash
# Generate metrics for your experiment
python conversation_metrics.py data/groups/thisiscere
```

### Key Areas for Experimentation

1. **Model Selection**
   - Try different model sizes and architectures
   - Compare specialized models (e.g., CodeLlama) with general models
   - Test latest models from the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.ai/library)

2. **Parameter Tuning**
   - Adjust temperature for creativity vs. precision
   - Modify max_tokens for different output lengths
   - Fine-tune top_p for different sampling strategies

3. **Processing Configuration**
   - Experiment with batch_size for different processing speeds
   - Adjust max_context_messages for different context windows
   - Try different confidence thresholds

### Tips for Systematic Experimentation

- Keep a log of your experiments and their results
- Change one parameter at a time to understand its impact
- Monitor both performance metrics and resource usage
- Consider trade-offs between accuracy and processing speed
- Document any interesting findings or patterns you discover

Remember: The goal is to improve upon the baseline Mistral 7B performance (ARI score of 0.219) by finding the right combination of model and parameters for optimal conversation clustering.

# Step 5: Start understanding the modifying the prompts, pre-grouping techniques, models

## Models Configuration

The project uses a flexible model configuration system that allows you to easily experiment with different models and parameters. The configuration is managed through `open_source_examples/model_config.yaml`.

### Key Components:

1. **Model Settings**
   - Choose from various Ollama models (e.g., Mistral, Phi-2, LLaMA 2, CodeLLama)
   - Configure temperature, max tokens, and top_p parameters
   - Example configuration:
   ```yaml
   model:
     name: "phi"  # Model name
     temperature: 0.3  # Lower for more focused outputs
     max_tokens: 1000  # Response length limit
     top_p: 0.95  # Sampling parameter
   ```

2. **Prompt Management**
   - Prompts are stored in separate text files
   - Easy to modify and experiment with different prompting strategies
   - Configuration specifies the prompt file:
   ```yaml
   prompt:
     path: "conversation_detection_prompt.txt"
   ```

3. **Output Configuration**
   - Flexible output formatting (CSV, JSON)
   - Configurable timestamp formats
   - Confidence score inclusion options
   ```yaml
   output:
     format: "csv"
     include_confidence: true
     timestamp_format: "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"
     output_dir: "data/groups"
   ```

4. **Processing Parameters**
   - Batch size control for efficient processing
   - Context window size configuration
   - Confidence thresholds for filtering results
   ```yaml
   processing:
     batch_size: 8
     max_context_messages: 5
     min_confidence_threshold: 0.7
   ```

## Model Playground

The project includes a model playground (`open_source_examples/model_playground.py`) for experimenting with different models and configurations:

1. **Key Features**:
   - Interactive testing of different models
   - Batch processing of messages
   - Standardized output formatting
   - Robust error handling and logging
   - Easy integration with Ollama models

2. **Usage**:
   ```bash
   python model_playground.py data/groups/thisiscere/messages_thisiscere.csv --config open_source_examples/model_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Customization**:
   - Modify `model_config.yaml` to experiment with different models
   - Adjust processing parameters for your use case
   - Test different prompt strategies by modifying the prompt file

## Modifying Prompts

To experiment with different prompting strategies:

1. **Locate the prompt file** specified in `model_config.yaml`
2. **Modify the prompt** while maintaining the `[MESSAGES]` placeholder
3. **Test the changes** using the model playground
4. **Evaluate results** using the metrics scripts

### Best Practices for Prompt Engineering:

1. **Clear Instructions**: Ensure prompts are clear and specific
2. **Consistent Format**: Maintain the expected output format (CSV structure)
3. **Context Window**: Consider the model's context window limitations
4. **Required Fields**: Always include message_id, conversation_id, topic, and timestamp
5. **Error Handling**: Include guidance for edge cases and error conditions
